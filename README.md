- A comprehensive test suite.
- Fully asynchronous.
- Support for all Redis commands.
- PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE support.
- Full transactional support (including nested transactions) (i.e., MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD) (to my knowledge, not present in [redis-node-client](http://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client)).
- Idiomatic command syntax.
- Automatic re-establishment of connections to the Redis server.

### Dependencies
The Vows Testing Framework:
From git:
    git clone http://github.com/cloudhead/vows.git
Or from npm:
    npm install vows

### Installation
From npm:
    npm install redis-node

OR

From git:
    git clone http://github.com/bnoguchi/redis-node.git

### A Quick Tour
    var redis = require("redis-node");
    var client = redis.createClient();    // Create the client
    client.select(2);                     // Select database 2

    // Assign the string "world" to the "hello" key.
    // You can provide a callback to handle the response from Redis
    // that gets asynchronously run upon seeing the response.
    client.set("hello", "world", function (err, status) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(status); // true
    });

    // ... but you don't have to provide a callback.
    client.set("hello", "world");

    // We may or may not be connected yet, but that's ok, since
    // the client queues up any commands.

    // The commands are also idiomatic
    client.hmset("hash", { t: "rex", steg: "asaurus" }, function (err, status) {
      if (err) throw err;
      sys.log(status); // true
    });

    // Support for transactions
    console.log("Transfer from checking to savings.");
    client.transaction( function () {
      client.decrby("checking", 100, function (err, balance) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("Checking Balance: " + balance);
      });
      client.incrby("savings", 100, function (err, balance) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("Savings Balance: " + balance);
      });
    });

    // With automatic transaction discard if there are any syntactic errors
    client.transaction( function () {
      client.set("I'm missing a 2nd argument"); // Our client with automatically discard the transaction
    });

See test/ for examples of each command.

# API Reference
## redis.createClient(port, host, options)
Creates a new Client instance connected to the Redis server running on host:port.
`host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`
`port` defaults to `6379`
You can pass in an options hash, too.  They default to:
- `maxReconnectionAttempts` (10) The number of times to try reconnecting to the Redis server before giving up.
- `reconnectionDelay` (500) How many milliseconds to wait before the 1st reconnection attempt. Using the strategy of exponential backoff, the delay doubles with every re-connection attempt.

## Events
The redis-node client emits important events related to the connection with the Redis
server. You can bind an event handler to any of the following events:
- `connected`
    Emitted when the client successfully makes a connection FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
    You usually will not need to bind an event handler to `connected` because the 
    client takes care of queueing up any commands you send it and flushes them 
    to the Redis server once it is connected.
- `disconnected`
    Emitted when we drop a connection with the Redis server. This can happen if the
    connection times out due to no recent activity from the client.
- `reconnecting`
    Emitted just before the client attempts to reconnect to the Redis server.
- `reconnected`
    Emitted when the client successfully makes a successful reconnection.
- `noconnection`
    Emitted when the client gives up its connection attempts.
- `connection error`
    Emitted when the there is an error that is a result of the connection with the
    Redis server. The error object is passed to `callback`. If you do not register
    a listener with this event, then the error is thrown and the program exits.

## Commands operating on all value types

### client.exists(key, callback)
Test if a key exists.
Passes `true` to callback if it exists.
Passes `false` to callback if it does not.
    client.exists("some-key", function (err, doesExist) {
        console.log(doesExist);
    });

### client.del(key1, key2, ..., keyn, callback)
Delete a key.
Passes the number of keys that were deleted to `callback`.
    client.exists("key1", "key2", function (err, numRemoved) {
        console.log(numRemoved); // 2
    });

### client.type(key, callback)
Passes the type of value stored at key to `callback`. One of:
- `none` if the key does not exist
- `string` if the key contains a `String` value
- `list` if the key contains a `List` value
- `set` if the key contains a `Set` value
- `zset` if the key contains a `Sorted Set` value
- `hash` if the key contains a `Hash` value
    client.type("key-with-string", function (err, type) {
        console.log(type); // Either: 'none', 'string', 'list', 'set', 'zset', or 'hash'
    });

### client.keys(pattern, callback)
Passes all the keys matching a given pattern to `callback`.
    // The * pattern returns an array of all keys
    client.keys("*", function (err, arrayOfKeys) {
        arrayOfKeys.forEach( function (key) {
            console.log(key);
        });
    });

    // .* patterns
    client.keys("key*", function (err, arrayOfKeys) {
        arrayOfKeys.forEach( function (key) {
            console.log(key);
        });
    });

    // ? patterns
    client.keys("?ar", function (err, arrayOfKeys) {
        arrayOfKeys.forEach( function (key) {
            console.log(key); // e.g., 'car', 'bar', 'far'
        });
    });

### client.randomkey(callback)
Passes a random key from the key space to `callback`.
    client.randomkey( function (err, key) {
        console.log(key);
    });

### client.rename(oldName, newName, callback)
Renames the old key name `oldName` to the new key name `newName`
Passes `true` to `callback`.
    client.rename("old", "new", function (err, didSucceed) {
        console.log(didSucceed); // true
    });

### client.renamenx(oldName, newName, callback)
Renames the old key name `oldName` to the new key name `newName`,
if the `newName` key does not already exist.
Passes `1` if `newName` key did not already exist, to `callback`.
Passes `0` if `newName` key did already exist, to `callback`.
    client.renamenx("old", "new", function (err, didSucceed) {
        console.log(!!didSucceed); // true
    });

### client.dbsize(callback)
Passes the number of keys in the current db.
    client.dbsize( function (err, numKeys) {
        console.log(numKeys);
    });

### client.expire(key, ttl, callback)
Tells Redis to delete the `key` after `ttl` seconds.
If we are using Redis < 2.1.3 and if a `ttl` was already set with 
another prior `client.expire` invocation, then the new `ttl` does 
NOT override the old `ttl`.
If we are using Redis >= 2.1.3 and if a `ttl` was already set with 
another prior `client.expire` invocation, then the new `ttl` DOES
override the old `ttl`.
The expiry can be removed from the key if the key is set to a new value using
the `client.set(key, value)` command or when a key is destroyed via the 
`client.del(key)` command.
Passes `1` to `callback` if `key` has no current `ttl` expiry.
Passes `0` to `callback` if `key` does not exist or if we
are using Redis < 2.1.3, and `key` already has a current `ttl` expiry.
    client.expire("key", 2, function (err, didSetExpiry) {
        console.log(!!didSetExpiry);
    });

### client.expireat(key, unixtime, callback)
Tells Redis to delete the `key` at the `unixtime` datetime in the future.
Works similarly to `client.expire(key, ttl, callback)`
    client.expireat("key", parseInt((+new Date) / 1000, 10) + 2, function (err, didSetExpiry) {
        console.log(didSetExpiry);
    });

### client.ttl(key, callback)
Gets the time to live (i.e., how many seconds before `key` expires) in seconds
of `key`.
Passes the number of seconds before `key` expires to `callback`.
Passes `-1` to `callback` if `key` has no ttl expiry.
    client.ttl("key", function (err, ttl) {
        console.log(ttl);
    });

### client.select(dbIndex, callback)
Selects the DB with the specified `dbIndex`.
Passes `true` to `callback`.
    client.select(2, function (err, didSucceed) {
        console.log(didSucceed); // true
    });

### client.move(key, dbIndex, callback)
Moves `key` from the currently selected DB to the `dbIndex` DB.
You can use `client.move` as a locking primitive.
Passes `1` to `callback` if `key` was moved successfully.
Passes `0` if the target `key` was already there or if the source `key`
was not found at all.
    client.move("key", 3, function (err, didSucceed) {
        console.log(!!didSucceed);
    });

### client.flushdb(callback)
Deletes all the keys of the currently selected DB. The command never fails.
Passes `true` to `callback`.
    client.flushdb( function (err, didSucceed) {
        console.log(didSucceed); // true
    });

### client.flushall(callback)
Deletes all the keys of all the existing databases, not just the currently
selected one. This command never fails.
Passes `true` to `callback`.
    client.flushall( function (didSucceed) {
        console.log(didSucceed); // true
    });
